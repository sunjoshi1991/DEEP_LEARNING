DATA : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

1) GENERATING (PREDICTING) NEXT CHARACTER OF MUSICAL NOTES(TEXT) UISNG CHAR RNN(LSTM).
2) TASK IS TO PREDICT THE NEXT CHARACTER FROM GIVEN INPUT TEXT(MUSICAL NOTE) DATA.
3) DEVELOPED A LSTM (RNN) MODEL WITH EMBEDDING, DROPOUT, AND SOFTMAX ACTIVATION WHICH GIVES 90% TRAIN ACCURACY GIVEN THE SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE OF LSTM.
